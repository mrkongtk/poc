Welcome to the "Proofs of Concepts" project, where I present various demos that I've created.

This Proof of Concept allows the player to immerse themselves in captivating 360 panorama images. Possible extensions for this concept include implementing the ability for the player to move around within the 360 environment, enabling a dynamic image change based on the player's location. Moreover, this immersive 360-degree view could be utilized as a stunning background for city-based games, enhancing the overall gaming ambience.

### How to Explore the Demos

- Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through different panorama images.
- Right-click and move the mouse to change the viewing angle and direction.
